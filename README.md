<h1> Alarm System - Using Object Detection </h1>

<h2> The aim of the project: </h2>

The aim of this project is to create an alarm monitoring system
for home surveillance with the capabilities of direct, live contact
when intruders are detected.

In the day and age where machine learning and artifical intelligence
is utilised to track & monitor for targetted individuals and tracking,
it is pivotal to understand the key technology and current software 
for this sector. 


<h3>What Is Deep Learning Object Detection</h3>

<i>All information is sourced from viso.ai</i>

1. Person detection:

This detection format is a variant of object detection used to detect a 
primary class "person" in images or video frames. 

2. Why is deep learning so important?

As one of the key basis for other downstream computer vision tasks such as
image segmentation, image captionining and object tracking + countless others.
