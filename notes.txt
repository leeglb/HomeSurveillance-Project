Some notes for our project:




So what do we want to actually implement or do?

1. We know that currently our CCTV starts as soon as it opens.

2. This is to reduce privacy issues.

3. We track for individuals, which is counted on the bottom using a visual text display.

4. Good, we track number of people.

5. First off, we need to implement the capturing system. Right now it captures, but we want it to capture just the essentials.

6. We can capture 10 seconds before and 10 seconds after someone is noticed. But for a real world situation we can choose duration length. 

7. That covers capturing, we would just store this to a file where the date, time and location name is chosen by the user --> use f"{}"

8. Emailing system is fine, we can see if we can email the video otherwise leave it as this could take alot of storage on someones phone.

9. But for the email, we gotta think of the intervals we should email to notify. Perhaps if there is someone detected, we can wait 5 seconds to see if the person count goes back to 0, otherwise email every 2 minutes?


As of tonight: 10/01/2026

We have utilised a buffer to pretty much implement a first in first out. Now we need to
fix the frame rate so that our output video matches the right speed and frame rate otherwise its too fast.
Furthermore, we need to fix the datetime and etc. 
We need to write about this in our notebook, and explain how we utilise a buffer and the theory behind it. 
Try avoid AI from now on so we can actually learn a bit more.
